    <h1>derrick Lo</h1>
        <p>I am a Los Angeles-based visual designer and consumer who specializes in UX/UI design, branding & corporate identity, and copywriting. <br><br>My work reflects a penchant for structured frameworks, clean aesthetics, and strong attention to detail. I believe in a "less is more" approach to designâ€”one that is subtle, self-aware, respectful, and engaging.</p></div>
