              <p><strong>Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry.</strong><br> Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. <br><em>It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</em> It was popularised in the 1960s with the release of Letraset sheets containing <sub>Lorem Ipsum</sub> passages, and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of <sup>Lorem Ipsum</sup>.</p>
